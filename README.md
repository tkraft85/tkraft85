- 👋 Hi, I’m @tkraft85
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding languages that will allow myself to better analyze data.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning html, css, java, and a little python and sql for long term.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that would help me better understand the real world applications of coding languages.
- 📫 You can reach me @t.a.kraft85@gmail.com
